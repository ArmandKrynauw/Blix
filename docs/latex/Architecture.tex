\section{Design Strategy}
Our design process used the \textbf{Decomposition} and \textbf{Design based on
quality requirements} strategies.

Application of \textbf{Decomposition Strategy:}

Our system has been designed in individual components or subsystems. The
interaction of these components create the fully functioning system. This
interaction of subsystems is used for the system's Architectural style and
pattern decisions.

Application of \textbf{Design based on quality requirements Strategy:}

Each subsystem has also been created based on certain quality requirements in
mind to ensure when interacting together, the system meets the specified
requirements.

% The system has been created using the decomposition design strategy. 
% Our system holds true to this description, as smaller component subsystems have been created and their interaction creates the fully functioning system.

% Each subsystem has also been created based on certain quality requirements in mind to ensure when brought together, the system meets its requirements.

% As the decomposition strategy is described, (Software Architecture in Practice - 3rd, Len Bass et al. 2013)'In some contexts, the system may end up being constructed mostly from preexisting components; in others, the preexisting components may be a smaller portion of the overall system.'(page 312). 


\section{Architectural Styles}



\pagebreak

\section{Quality Requirements}

\subsection{Performance}

\subsubsection*{Description}
The application should demonstrate efficient speed and
responsiveness when editing large images and handling multiple projects.
Real-time processing of graph-based image operations should be seamless and
should not cause any delay during editing. The application should be able to
support the execution of multiple system plugins that should not cause any
significant performance degradation.

\subsubsection*{Quantification}
The performance requirement will be measured by defining specific metrics, such
as the maximum size of images that can be edited without lag, the duration of
time it takes for the application to load and display images of various sizes,
and the average time taken for the application to process a graph-based image
operation. The application's performance with different numbers of open projects
and running plugins can also be benchmarked by measuring the percentage of CPU
and RAM usage and observing performance during peak usage.


\subsection{Customizability}
\subsubsection*{Description}


\subsection{Reliability} 
\subsubsection*{Description}

The system should be able to recover from unexpected shutdowns or errors without
losing data.

The system should be able to store and retrieve images and projects reliably.


\subsection{Usability} 
The system should be clear and concise on how it should be operated. 

The system must ensure that users can easily navigate and use the system without
external assistance or unwarranted difficulty. All functionality must be
properly documented such that high-end users can easily perform complex
operations.

\subsection{Security} 

\subsubsection*{Description}
The application must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
user data by protecting against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification,
or destruction. Furthermore, the application and its plugin system must be
resilient to attacks from third-party entities and malicious users.

\subsubsection*{Quantification}
The application should isolate and sandbox plugin code to prevent it from
accessing sensitive user information and core system functionality.

The application should use encryption for sensitive user data both at-rest and
in-transit. 

\subsection{Compatibility} 

\subsubsection*{Description}
The application must be compatible with major operating systems such as Windows,
macOS, and Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian. It should support
image file formats commonly used in the industry such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP,
and RAW from popular camera brands.

\subsubsection*{Quantification}
The application must be able to run without errors on the latest stable versions
of the aforementioned operating systems. It must be able to import and export
image files with the aforementioned formats without any data loss or corruption. 


% \subsection{Availability}

% The system should allow plugins to be loaded in real time while the system is
% running.


\section{Architectural Design \& Patterns}
Three main architectural patterns where identified to decompose the base system
into components and subsystems.

\subsection{Model-View-Controller (MVC)}
The MVC pattern was chosen in order to create clear separation between the user
interface, business logic and system data. The disconnected nature of these
components allow 


\subsection{Publish-Subscribe}


\subsection{Client Server}


\section{Constraints}


\section{Technology Choices}

\subsection{Svelte}
Svelte is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It
is designed to be highly efficient and focused on delivering optimal performance
by shifting the work from the runtime to the build process. One of the key
visions of Blix is to provide a fast and responsive user interface with
lightning fast reactivity. Additionally due to the large scope of the project,
it is important to ensure that the system is as lightweight as possible. Svelte
is the perfect choice for this as it is a lightweight framework

\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
	\item[\textbullet] Fast and responsive user interface with lightning fast reactivity. 
	\item[\textbullet] Svelte is a highly scalable framework that allows for the creation of large scale applications.
	\item[\textbullet] Reusability of components shortens development time.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
	\item[\textbullet] Svelte is a relatively new framework and as such has a smaller community than other frameworks such as React and Vue.
	\item[\textbullet] Svelte has a smaller ecosystem than other frameworks such as React and Vue.
	\item[\textbullet] Svelte is lacking in stabilty as it is still a relatively new framework.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tailwind CSS}
Tailwind CSS is an utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed, low-level utility classes. Tailwind CSS focuses on providing a comprehensive set of utility classes that you can combine to build custom user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS is the perfect choice for Blix as it allows for the creation of a custom user interface that is unique to Blix. 
Additionally, Tailwind CSS is highly scalable and allows for the creation of large scale applications.
